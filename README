Nitpick is a distributed issue tracker. It's intended to be used with source
code such that the issues can follow the code via whatever VCS or distribution
mechanism.

Once the repository has been created you will likely want to configure the
repository. This is done by editing the files in .nitpick/config.

The config file contains the bulk of the settings in the colon titled format
with spaces between the item, eg. "components: Documentation UI Backend". The
default will be the first item in the list. When presented as a list of options
all the options will be presented in the order listed in the configuration.

The fields are as follows:
components - The list of components which will be give as options
	     Default: Documentation
fix_by     - targets for when an issue should be closed by
             Default: Next_Release
priority   - Priority given to the issue
             Default: 1 2 3 4 5
severity   - Severity of the issue
             Default: Blocker Critical Major Minor Trivial
state      - Current state of the issue
             Default: New Confirmed Open Diagnosed Fixed Closed
resolution - Resolution of an issue after it has been dealt with
             Default: None Fixed WontFix Invalid WorksForMe
type       - The various types of issues
             Default: Bug Feature Regression

The users file simply contains the list of selectable users, one per line, in a
free form. By default the only user is the Unassigned user.
