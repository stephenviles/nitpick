As can be seen in issue b683523f9c4245af19fbd95c219641bd7e94c20db177c028051ede9dcb107d7d (b683523f9c4245af19fbd95c219641bd7e94c20db177c028051ede9dcb107d7d). If an issue description has more than one link (say http://travisbrown.ca/projects/nitpick/docs/nitpick.html and http://travisbrown.ca/projects/nitpick/docs/nitpick.html, then only the first one will be linked.
