From the discussion here (http://curtis.lassam.net/pierc/#id-790719) is seems that it could be useful to support non hour based time measurements. Specifically complexity based estimates.

If we allow integer values for time estimation of a project (nominally hours) and further allow float values for the time a dev has available on any particular average day of the week then we can either have that scaleless number represent hours or complexity units.

This would enable the Agile style Planning Poker.
