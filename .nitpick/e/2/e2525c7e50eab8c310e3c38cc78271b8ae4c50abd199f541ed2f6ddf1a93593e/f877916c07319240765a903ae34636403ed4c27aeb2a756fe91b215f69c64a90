To produce a Gantt chart any particular issue needs:
- An owner
- An estimated time of work
- An estimated current completion
- A started timestamp
- A finished timestamp

Every user also must have a number of hours per day (likely for any day of the week) they will be working on this project.

Every Fix_By also requires a deadline so a critical path can be computed, though the system should attempt to find the minimum time option. Assuming that any single person will only ever work on a single issue at a time is reasonable.
