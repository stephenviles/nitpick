Overlapping tasks to show the partial completion status is perhaps not worth it.

- It's quite a bit of work to do this because HTML tables don't work in a useful manner for this.
- It will greatly increase the horizontal space needed to show the schedule. This will make things less useful.

I'm going to make this a new issue to consider later, a7fcc48d23763e695d24293c64733ea2b05721a5358ae07b66697b6d7dea9fea
