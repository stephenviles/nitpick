Unfortunately adding that information makes the entire setup NP-Complete.

If I can work out an efficient algorithm for the simple case of only inside the dependency tree, then two modes could be provided. A most where none of the tasks have non-zero earliest possible start times (meaning they can't start immediately assuming all the dependencies where magically complete) and then a mode where there are these external earliest possible start times for some tasks.
