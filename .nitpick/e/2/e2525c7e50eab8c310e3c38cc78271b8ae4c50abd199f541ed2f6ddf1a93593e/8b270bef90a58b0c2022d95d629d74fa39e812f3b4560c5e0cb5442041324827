After trying it, I don't believe that statically colouring the critical path is the right thing to do. It's non-trivial to mark the tasks on the critical path in such a way that a minimal set is marked and every time span is covered.

abd97310fcb2 seems to cover the need of marking the critical path and does it in a more general and accurate way.
