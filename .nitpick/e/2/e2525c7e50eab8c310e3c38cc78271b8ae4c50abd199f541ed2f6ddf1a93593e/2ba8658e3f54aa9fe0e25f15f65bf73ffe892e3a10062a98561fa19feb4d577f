One feature that would be useful is to have items which aren't completed coloured based upon their completion status. So the first x% would be green, the last 100-x% blue to signify that approximately x% has been completed.

If the issues in the past are only those which haven't been completed completely yet then doing this should give a decent idea of which tasks are on schedule and which are behind.
