Title: Synchronize with external bug trackers
Type: Feature
--
Looking at the discussion at there two links http://kitenet.net/pipermail/dist-bugs/ and http://dist-bugs.branchable.com/ it seems that synchronizing with and existing bug trackers could be useful.

One useful example would be if one used git as the VCS and github as a public display. It would be useful to bidirectionally synchronize with this public bug tracker.
