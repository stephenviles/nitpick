Here's the situation. In subversion 1.6 if you were inside the .nitpick directory and the svn:external was in the project root (to avoid infinitely recursive externals) then the Foreign projects would still be marked as such.

However, with subversion 1.7 this is no longer the case. Inside .nitpick 'svn stat' now shows a status of ? for the external instead of X.
