Support for this has been added. However, existing Nitpick repositories won't have all the metadata required to be compatible. The quickest way to solve the issue is to update the metadata of the issues outside Nitpick.

To do this you first need to write a small script such as:

#!/bin/bash
awk '/--/ {print "Depends_On:\nDuplicate_Of:";} {print}' $1 > $1.tmp
mv $1.tmp $1

I called this script add_fields.sh. Then in each of the project directories you can run the command:

find .nitpick -name issue -exec /path/to/add_fields.sh \{\} \;

After that is done you should test with Nitpick and if the issues load fine you can go ahead and commit this change manually.
