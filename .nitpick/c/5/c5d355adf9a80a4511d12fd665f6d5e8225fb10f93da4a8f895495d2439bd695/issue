One use case for distributed bug tracking is to have a separate branch which stores all the bug information. Nitpick can currently support this usage, but it involves having a checkout of that special branch where Nitpick is run. It should be possible to have Nitpick access the required branch directly.

The greatest challenge might be portably detecting that this alternate branch should be used.
