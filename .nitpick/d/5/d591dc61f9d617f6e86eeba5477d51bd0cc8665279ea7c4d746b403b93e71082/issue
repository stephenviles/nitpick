Title: Option to dynamically collapse comment threads
Type: Feature
Units_of_Work: 1000
--
Sooner than later I'm going to start integrating Lousy into Nitpick. When I do that the number of comments on a bug will start to increase. This means there will be comment threads I don't want to read at this moment. I could implement some filtering functionality, but dynamic collapsing is more generally applicable.

This should be a javascript thing in the web interface so it's fast.
