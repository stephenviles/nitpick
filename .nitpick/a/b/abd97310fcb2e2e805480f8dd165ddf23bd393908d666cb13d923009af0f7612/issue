Title: Gantt hover dependency graph highlight

The graph I display for the project schedule isn't really a Gantt chart, but is instead a work queue ordering. This makes it difficult to see what the dependencies are.

What should be done is that when a task is hovered over all the dependencies are highlighted in one colour and all the dependent tasks are highlighted another. This would make it easy to dynamically see where the project paths are.
