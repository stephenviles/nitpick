Title: Overlap partial tasks in schedule

It is not only possible, but likely that on a schedule there will be tasks which are partially complete. It makes sense to show the partial completion of these tasks.

One way to do this is to have (vertically) some representation like:
 |----|
    |##----|

Where #'s are the portion of work already complete and -'s are the portion of work still to be done.
