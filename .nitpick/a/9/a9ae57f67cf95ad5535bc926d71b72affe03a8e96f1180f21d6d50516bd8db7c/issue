Title: Use Higher density ID encoding
Type: Feature
Units_of_Work: 1000
--
Currently Nitpick uses a hexidecimal encoding for the issue identifiers. This is common, but the full length identifiers are quite long. As I discussed in http://travisbrown.ca/blog.html#TooMuchAboutDistributedBugTracking2013-04-20 it's possible to use other encodings, most of which have higher densities.

The hexidecimal encoding requires 64 characters for the full identifier.
One obvious encoding would be base36 (a-z0-9) which would only require 50 characters.

Base32 has a few variants which avoid characters which look alike. It would only require 52 characters.
