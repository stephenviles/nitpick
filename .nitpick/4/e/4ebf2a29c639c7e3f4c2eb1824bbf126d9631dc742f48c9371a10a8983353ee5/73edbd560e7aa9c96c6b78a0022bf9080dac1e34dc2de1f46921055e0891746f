One thought on the implementation is for each Nitpick database to have a file which contains a project name and UUID.

The UUID would be used to combine issues from different branches of the same project. So if you had a branch database and a trunk database as a parallel database then you would not see issues which are in both databases, but would instead see a combined/merged version.

However, if you had a number of parallel databases from different projects then you would see which project they came from. This would be useful perhaps if you wanted to configure a Nitpick database to look over a number of subprojects.

Say somebody uses Nitpick for each of their personal projects and wants to setup something so they can view all the bugs for all the projects from one spot.
