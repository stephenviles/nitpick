Title: Parallel Databases
Type: Feature
--
Currently Nitpick only supports one single database. This works fine as long as the intent is to use the bug tracker only on a single branch view at a time.

Thus is a bug is entered in the trunk of a project, then it won't be visible in the branches until such time that the branch syncs with the trunk.

This is likely alright for development, but causes problems when it comes to letting users or support people enter bugs. It is unlikely to be a sufficient reason to trigger a branch sync or merge just to receive updated issues.

Instead Nitpick should have the ability to have multiple parallel databases. This would probably have to use functionality like svn:externals to have a second database appear in the branch, but actually be located in some central location (such as a support bug branch or the trunk).
