When it comes to parallel issues (ie. has a copy in the trunk and a copy in the current branch) these issues should perhaps be merged so that all the available comments appear. Since we have nested comments that is easy enough.

The more difficult issue comes with merging the metadata of an issue. Perhaps we can use some sort of ghosting mechanism to show the state in all the non-current branches/databases?
