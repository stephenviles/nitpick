This feature required adding a uuid to the repository. The following short script can be run inside the .nitpick directory to create the necessary uuid file.

#!/usr/bin/env python2.7

import uuid

uuid_file = open('uuid', 'w')
uuid_file.write(uuid.uuid4().hex)
uuid_file.close()

Once the uuid file has been created you must add and commit it to the VCS manually.
