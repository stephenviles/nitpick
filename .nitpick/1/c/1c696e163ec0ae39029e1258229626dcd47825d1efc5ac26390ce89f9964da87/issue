Title: Don't show clone foreign repos as a new issue option
Type: Bug
--
When you have foreign repositories setup and you go to create an issue you are presented with a list of repositories to use. If you have a clone foreign repository (such as a foreign project to the trunk of the current project when you are on a branch) you will be presented with both 'local' and 'trunk', even though you can't actually create a bug in 'trunk'.

Filter these cloned repositories out.
