Title: Issue Filtering and Sorting Support
Type: Feature
--
The great advantage of the Web UI is that it's an easy way to interact with significant amounts of data.

Unfortunately bug trackers usually get too large even for that.

Provide support for filtering and sorting the issue list on various fields, such as:
- Owner
- State
- Priority
- Fix_By
- Type
