Having a local bug tracker which follows the developer and all is nice, but not sufficient. It must be possible to easily provide a public, modifiable copy of the tracker for use by QA people, or users.

The single user UI is entirely too inefficient for this, but could perhaps be helped by running as a script under a real webserver.
