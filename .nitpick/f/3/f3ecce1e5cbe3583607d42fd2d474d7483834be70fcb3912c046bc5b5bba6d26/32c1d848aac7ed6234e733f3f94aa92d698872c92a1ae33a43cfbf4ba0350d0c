There would have to be some sort of moderation when moving issues back to the primary VCS copy. Maybe a recommended setup would be to have a plain filesystem/VCS export version of the repository with the script/whatever Public UI running. Then every so often a person can run a synchronization/moderation script which gives simple choices to add the public change for a bug to the repo or not.
