One possible way to do this would be to punt it off to the VCS. For many cases just looking at a diff and reverting anything which doesn't seem correct would cover many cases. This is likely what the initial tool will be like.

In the future it would be possible, but significant work, to present a moderation view where anything which isn't part of the issue repository is coloured and a list between modified issues. But this would only be done if some scripting around the VCS isn't sufficient.
