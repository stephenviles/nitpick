Title: Schedule should not have gaps on weekends
Type: Bug
Units_of_Work: 1000
--
In the schedule when a task finishes on a day before a weekend, the next task will start on the day after the weekend. This will cause a gap to be shown over the weekend. Gaps should only be for time that nothing can be scheduled.

Extending tasks which end just before a non-work day to the start of the next work day should fix this issue.
