Title: Support SVN foreign projects through symlinks
Type: Feature
Units_of_Work: 1000
--
Nitpick supports foreign projects using SVN externals pretty well. However a meta-tracker with a large number of foreign projects using externals makes running svn update pretty slow.

It should be possible to symlink to these sub-trackers as long as they are within the same checkout. Currently this doesn't work though because Nitpick treats the entire directory as either a svn working copy or as containing svn externals. Symlinks are neither and thus don't work.
