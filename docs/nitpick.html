		If you want to get started with Nitpick as quickly as possible these are the steps
		you have to follow:
		<ol>
			<li>Download Nitpick and place nitpick.py into a directory in you path. You
			may wish to rename the file nitpick</li>

			<li>At the root of your project you must create a Nitpick repository. Run
			the command <tt>nitpick init --vcs <i>vcs</i></tt> where <i>vcs</i> is the
			VCS your project uses. Currently supported are: <tt>file</tt>, <tt>git</tt>,
			<tt>hg</tt> and <tt>svn</tt>.</li>

			<li>Start the Nitpick Web Interface by running the command <tt>nitpick
				web</tt> somewhere in the directory tree at or above your project
			root</li>

			<li>Create issues, comment on those issues and hit the <tt>Commit</tt>
			button to commit those changes into your local VCS.</li>
		</ol>

	<a name="what_is_nitpick"><a href="#what_is_nitpick"><h1>What is Nitpick?</h1></a></a>
		<p>
		Nitpick is a distributed issue tracker which keeps the issues alongside the code in
		the project verson control system. Similar to traditional centralized issue or bug
		trackers you can create issues, comment on issues, change various bits of metadata
		about issues and add attachments to issues. Unlike traditional issue trackers there
		is no central web server you have to access. Instead the issue database lives beside
		the source code inside the same version control system.
		</p>

		<p>
		Having the issue database beside the code provides several advantages over
		traditional issue trackers. The first of these is that no matter where the developer
		is they can view, modify and create issues. There is no central web server which
		requires Internet to access. For projects which use a DVCS like git or Mercurial,
		the advantages of having the issues beside the project are similar to the advantages
		of using those systems over a centralized VCS. These include disconnected operation
		and increased redundancy of the issue database, there is no central point of
		failure.
		</p>

		<p>
	 	One big feature of storing the issue database beside the code in a VCS is that when
		you branch the code you are also branching the issue database. If you create a
		branch to solve some particular issue then inside that branch you can create
		comments against that issue to document various decisions. Within that same branch
		you would mark the issue as closed and when that branch was merged back into the
		mainline the issue database there will automatically be updated with the new issue
		status.
		</p>

		<p>
		Conversely, if a new long lived branch is created then new issues can be created
		against only that branch. There is no guessing which branch an issue corresponds to
		because the current issue database always refers to the current branch. Nitpick also
		supports combining multiple Nitpick repositories across multiple branches to provide
		a complete view to the developer. For more about this advanced feature see <a
			href="#foreign_projects">Foreign Projects</a> below.

	<a name="installation"><a href="#installation"><h1>Installation</h1></a></a>
		<p>
		Nitpick is a self contained system written in Python. All that it requires is a
		complete standard installation of Python 2.7. No additional Python libraries are
		required. Nitpick also requires the standard command line tools for you VCS.
		</p>

		<p>
		As a single file program installation is simply copying nitpick.py into a directory
		in your path and ensuring that the file is executable. An optional, but recommended,
		step is to rename the file nitpick, with no extension. All the commands in this
		manual will be written assuming you have named the Nitpick file "nitpick", but any
		name you desire will work.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Once Nitpick has been copied into place you are ready to start using it. No
		additional configuration is necessary.
		</p>

		<p>
		Unless you already have a project which has a Nitpick repository created for it you
		will have to create a new Nitpick repository. To do so you simply need to open a
		shell and go to the root of your project in source control. Once there you need only
		run the command <tt>nitpick init --vcs <i>vcs</i></tt>. This command will create a
		new Nitpick repository in the current directory under the hidden directory
		<tt>.nitpick</tt>. It will automatically initialize a default, empty repository and
		attempt to commit it to the VCS.
		</p>

		<p><i>vcs</i> must be chosen from the supported list of VCSes. Currently
		<tt>git</tt>, <tt>hg</tt>, <tt>svn</tt> and <tt>file</tt> are supported. The first
		three are well known VCSes. The <tt>file</tt> VCS is a null VCS which creates an
		unversioned Nitpick repository. This can be useful if you want to play around or try
		Nitpick with an unsupported VCS, though the <tt>file</tt> VCS doesn't support
		committing and reverting as the other VCS options do.
		</p>

		<p>
		If you use the Mercurial, <tt>hg</tt>, VCS option there is one additional step. In
		the project root you should see that the .hgignore file has been created/modified.
		You should review this file to ensure that it is acceptable. Nitpick has a few
		administrative files within its repository which must not be committed to the VCS
		and Nitpick will automatically add these files to the ignore list of the VCS. Since
		Mercurial requires modifying a user file it will not commit the ignore list
		automatically.
		</p>

	<a name="starting_the_web_interface"><a href="#starting_the_web_interface"><h2>Starting the Web Interface</h2></a></a>
		<p>
		Though there is a command line interface to Nitpick, it is not the preferred
		interface and exists primarily for scripts and power users. The preferred interface
		is the Web Interface.
		</p>

		<p>
		The Web Interface uses an embedded web server to serve pages to your local browser
		in order to create a familiar interface. Nitpick will attempt to cause your local
		browser to open a new tab or window to the Nitpick Web Interface. If contacting a
		graphical browser fails it will attempt to find and start one of the standard
		terminal browsers instead. Failing that Nitpick will notify you of the address where
		you can view the Web Interface.
		</p>

		<p>
		Starting the Nitpick Web Interface is as easy as running the command <tt>nitpick
			web</tt> inside your project. Nitpick will automatically search the parent
		and grandparents, etc. of the current directory to search for a Nitpick repository.
		</p>

		<p>
		Starting the Web Interface on a repository will bring up the issue list, which will
		look something like:
